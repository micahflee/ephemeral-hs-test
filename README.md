# Ephemeral Tor hidden service test

Install flask and stem in a virtualenv.

```sh
$ virtualenv env
$ . env/bin/activate
(env) $ pip install flask stem
(env) $ python ephemeral-hs-test.py # to run
```

Open Tor Browser 5.5a2 (or any version that includes Tor version >= 0.2.7.1-alpha) and run `ephemeral-hs-test.py`.

*Expected behavior:*

The script should start a simple web server, start a hidden service, and then eventually connect to itself.

*Actual behavior:*

```
$ python2 ephemeral-hs-test.py                              1 â†µ
